Pantheon's new [Global CDN](https://pantheon.io/global-cdn) is a core platform offering, with improved performance and security for customer sites. Content is served from 30+ global POPs (points of presence) where site pages and assets are cached, plus [free managed HTTPS](/docs/https) using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org).

## Fast HTTPS Translates to Revenue
Research has shown that each second of latency in rendering a site results in approxomately a 10% drop-off in user engagement. With more and more traffic coming through mobile devices (and their networks), meeting user expectations for performance can be a real challenge.

On top of that, Google and others are now directly factoring in performance and security as part of their SEO weighting algorithms. Browser makers are beginning to show obtrusive warnings for any login page or other form submission that happens "in the clear" over plain HTTP.

Pantheon is helping developers solve both of these challenges with one elegant solution: an integrated performance-first content delivery network which includes [free managed HTTPS service](/docs/https). Faster pages, all HTTPS, all the time.

## How Does It Work?
This new service takes Pantheon's traditional high-performance page and asset caching system (Varnish) and pushes it out globally. Rather than requests coming all the way to our primary datacenter, we can now terminate HTTPS and serve pages from a location much closer to the end-user. This speeds up the time to render a web-page significantly.

Additionally, the Global CDN has an improved cache strategy that eliminates Pantheon's legacy "cache sharding" which meant that the same content needed to be cached in separate edge cache instances. This means higher cache hit rates.

Finally, the Global CDN includes interfaces to dynamically expire selected content from the cache, rather than doing a full cache flush. There are basic implementations available as Drupal modules and WordPress plugins, as well as a developer API for implementing custom cache tagging/clearing behavior.

In early testing we saw multi-second speedups even within the continental US. International users will benefit even more:

## Granular Cache Clearing

Developers looking to take advantage of the granular cache clearing capabilities of the Global CDN are encouraged to start with our CMS integrations:


- WordPress: [Pantheon Advanced Page Cache](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/pantheon-advanced-page-cache)
- Drupal: D7 and D8 [Pantheon Advanced Page Cache](https://www.drupal.org/project/pantheon_advanced_page_cache)

Lower-level documentation for custom implementation of caching strategies is also coming soon. Please [contact our enablement team](https://pantheon.io/agencies/learn-pantheon) if you are interested in implementing a custom cache strategy.

## Enabling the Global CDN

If you don't see action required in your Domains / HTTPS tool, please [contact support](/docs/getting-support) to enable the upgrade.

### Upgrade Your Site

1. Click the **Start Upgrade** button from the Site Dashboard.
2. It can take up to an hour for the new certificate to deploy across the entire CDN. If you want to avoid any possible hiccoughs you can wait 60 minutes before updating DNS.

  If you want to proceed without waiting, we strongly recommend testing locally before making the final DNS change:

      1. Click the "Details" button next to your site's bare domain.
      2. Copy the "A" record's IP address provided for the site's bare domain.
      3. Add a line to your [local hosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)) file with the IP address from the previous step followed by the domain name, for example:

        ```
        192.123.456.789 example.com
        ```

      4. Test HTTPS locally by entering your domain in the browser. If the site is accessible over HTTPS with a <span class="secure glyphicons glyphicons-lock"></span> [Secure status](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95617?hl=en), the test was successful. Remove the edits made to your hosts file once you have finished testing.


3. Click **Details** next to each custom domain to identify DNS values needed to point the domain to your site. Domains that are not yet configured will indicate action is required. You will need to configure your DNS host to use the provided values.

</div>

  DNS records are cached across the internet and can take up to 72 hours to propagate, depending on the time to live (TTL) configured for the domain's DNS records. Most records update more quickly, and you can track the progress of DNS propagation.

</div>

4. If your site relied on the www-redirector provided on our Legacy service, you will need to [redirect incoming requests within `wp-config.php` or `settings.php`](/docs/guides/launch/redirects/).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is there a deadline to ugprade?
Ultimately the Global CDN will be the default for every site on Pantheon. We encourage customers to upgrade as soon as they have time to do the changes.

### I already have a CDN - should I switch?
Pantheon's Global CDN has some advantages over solutions some customers may already have in place:

1. It includes [free and automatic HTTPS service](/docs/https)
2. It is heavily optimized for website performance
3. It is configured, maintained, and supported by Pantheon
4. It is available at no additional cost

Even if you want to retain your existing CDN because of specific features they provide, the upgrade will improve your end-user experience, as your custom CDN will be able to pull pages and assets from a nearby Pantheon Global CDN location, rather than the origin datacenter.

### Is the www-redirector service still available?
No, the www-redirector service is part of the legacy infrastructure. You can choose your primary domain and redirect all traffic to HTTPS by adding [301 redirects](/docs/guides/launch/redirects/) to your site's configuration file (wp-config.php or settings.php).

### Are vanity domains supported?
You can upgrade a site to Global CDN that is using [vanity domains](/docs/vanity-domains/), but HTTPS will not be provisioned for the vanity domains. Only custom domains will have HTTPS provisioned.

### What about Cloudflare?
See [Cloudflare Domain Configuration](/docs/cloudflare/).

### Is the CDN configurable?
No, we pre-configured the CDN so you donâ€™t have to hassle with configuration, and we can guarantee performance and uptime. The Global CDN's behavior is the same as our legacy cache which is heavily optimized for Drupal and WordPress sites, and serves billions of pages monthly, except it's globally distributed.

### Do I get access to hit rates or other statistics?
Hit rates or other statistics are not currently available.

### Can I use other CDNs with Pantheon Global CDN?
Yes. We recommend that you ensure that you are enforcing HTTPS only at the outer CDN and are assuming HTTPS in the application. Check your CDN for how to redirect all traffic to HTTPS.
