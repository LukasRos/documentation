The site's framework is selected during the creation process. Pantheon Upstreams provide default installations of WordPress, Drupal 8 and Drupal 7. [Custom Upstreams](/docs/custom-upstream/) are available to team members when the organization is associated during site creation.

## Pantheon Upstreams
We base our Drupal 7 repository on the canonical source from drupal.org, and then extend it with [Pressflow](http://pressflow.org/) modifications and additional features to take advantage of the Pantheon runtime environment. The WordPress repository includes platform integration plugins and a pre-configured `wp-config.php`.

## Importing an Existing Site

Your site migration has four phases. Youâ€™ll package your site, import it, test it out, and then change DNS and go live. With a good plan and understanding of the platform, the process will run smoothly. For detailed information, see [Migrate Sites to Pantheon](/docs/migrate).
